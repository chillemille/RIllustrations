# R Illustrations
Collection R codes that serve as an illustration for the required code to run the different GSA tools

Run this code directly in R if you don't already have the `data` subdirectory, then place the required data in it. Oh, and make sure that your current working directory is this project. You can force RStudio to be in the correct working directory by opening the `.Rproj` file on your computer.

```
system("mkdir -p data")
```
